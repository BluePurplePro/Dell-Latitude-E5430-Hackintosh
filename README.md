# Result
## Working:
- iGPU
- Wifi & Bluetooth
- Internal Sound
- Keyboard
- Touchpad
- HDMI output
- Brightness
- Battery Status
- DVD Drive
- USB 3.0 ports
## Partially working:
- Sleep (Sleep is broken in Windows sometimes, MacOS is no exception)
- USB ports 2.0 ports
> [!NOTE]
> These USB 2.0 ports (EHCI Generic USB Hub) won't work after restarting. They only work after completely shutting down the laptop and booting straight to MacOS.

## Known issue(s):
- Some apps like Chess.app, Safari.app, etc got graphic artifacts/flickering when entering fullscreen mode (this flickering issue only affect 1366x768 display, 1600x900 one does not have this issue)

> [!NOTE]
> [Downgrading the BIOS to A03](https://github.com/BluePurplePro/Dell-Latitude-E5430-Hackintosh/blob/main/Downgrade_Dell_Latitude_E5430_BIOS.md) will fix graphic artifacts/flickering issue.

## Not working:
- Airplane Mode Switch
- Airdrop (Intel Wireless)
- VGA Output (Analog)
- AppleIntelPowerManagement (CFG Lock)
> [!NOTE]
> Follow [this guide](https://github.com/BluePurplePro/Disable-CFG-Lock-Dell-Machines) to turn off CFG-Lock on Dell Latitude E5430

_Not tested_:
- Express Card Expansion
- SD Card Reader (Mine is broken)
- Docking Station (I don't have a Docking Station for Dell Latitude E5430)
- SIM Slot (I don't have a WWAN Card, but [someone does make it work in MacOS though](https://github.com/xmm7360/xmm7360-usb-modeswitch))
